# referee-watch-prototype

## Intro

I've been a certified soccer referee since I was 13. For quite a while, this idea of a watch specifically designed to keep track of everything you need mid-game has been bouncing around in my head. It always felt clunky pulling a little notepad out everytime someone scored. Since I couldn't play or referee soccer myself while recovering from knee surgery this summer, I decided to try and make a functional prototype to keep me occupied. And, since my programming experience is limited to python and about 10 minutes of C, I figured I might as well see how hard it is to make a website. As is probably obvious by the commits in early September, this project took quite a bit longer than expected. I went through a decent portion of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript courses on https://w3schools.com/ and stumbled my way through this project with an abundance of Google searches and Stack Overflow queries. Ultimately, I'm happy with the result for my first time ever making a website or using Javascript, and I ended up with a website that isn't completely hideous. Feel free to point and laugh at my code or get some inspiration for your own projects. The below section documents the controls and features of my watch.
